<!--
Quicksand:

Vadi crouches low, running his hands along the ground in easy, flowing motions, speaking softly
under his breath. In response, the surface beneath grows turgid, spreading rapidly from him as it
forms a churning mass of quicksand.

You struggle slowly through the quicksand as you move northeastwards. - movement delay

You find it impossible to tumble through the treacherous quicksand. - can't tumble

Death:

Vadi closes his eyes, and pinpoints of deathly black miasma begin to surround him. - start of trance

The deathly black mist continues to build around Vadi. - continues to build

Vadi raises a trembling finger and points directly at you. A swirling miasma of black death descends
from above and wraps tightly around your body, dissipating moments later without effect. - fail, tried to kill

Vadi raises a trembling finger and points directly at you.
A swirling miasma of black death descends over you and all goes dark as you feel the life being
drawn from your flesh. You cannot help but open your mouth to scream as you breathe your very last
breath.
You have been slain by Vadi. - success, kill
