<!--
Akyaevin convulses, a stream of thick, putrid liquid spewing from his filth pump at you.
Your attack strikes one of Akyaevin's polluted studs, which spews a corrosive substance at you.
Akyaevin twists toward you, one of his rusted spikes throwing you off balance.
Akyaevin's cranial implant flares, a thin crackle of energy igniting the fumes surrounding him in tiny flashes on its way to strike you.
