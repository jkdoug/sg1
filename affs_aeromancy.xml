<!--
(Unleash Staff - Stage One)
Person releases His staff, which hovers in the air before Him. He raises up His arms, and clouds gather around a delicate crystal staff, which lets loose forks of lightning.
From the four directions, winds blow in and gather, rotating slowly and gathering more momentum. The clouds begin to twist as they follow in their wake.

(Unleash Staff - Stage Two)
Picking up speed, the relentlessly churning winds become more powerful, and lightning begins to strike out from among the swirling clouds.

(Unleash Staff - Stage Three, 60+% health damage and ~250 bleeding)
A towering cyclone forms, churning and twisting with the unrepentent force of the elements, lightning running riot within its cavernous maw. The winds pick you up and thrust you into the gauntlet of lightning blasts just before smashing you back into the ground.
